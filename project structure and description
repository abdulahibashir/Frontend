# 🖥️ Frontend Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Frontend Practice Repository** — a personal workspace where I explore, learn, and build different frontend projects.  
This repo serves as a collection of code samples, experiments, and mini-projects that help me strengthen my web development skills.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:
- Practice **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** fundamentals.
- Explore modern frontend frameworks like **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.
- Build and refine real-world UI components and responsive layouts.
- Store reusable code snippets and learning projects in one organized space.
